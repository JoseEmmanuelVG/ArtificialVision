<h1>Spatial Filtering</h1>

<h2>Frequency Domain Filtering</h2>
<p>Frequency filters process an image by working in the frequency domain in the Fourier Transform. To do this, the image is modified following the corresponding Convolution Theorem:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Apply the Fourier Transform.</li>
  <li>Then multiply it by the chosen filter function.</li>
  <li>Finally, apply the Inverse Fourier Transform to recover the image in the spatial domain.</li>
</ol>
<p>As multiplication in the Fourier space is identical to convolution in the spatial domain, theoretically, all filters could be implemented as spatial filters. The stages of frequency domain image processing are shown in the figure:</p>

<h2>Spatial Filters</h2>
<p>Spatial filters are implemented using a process called spatial convolution. It is a mathematical method used in signal processing and analysis, also known as a finite impulse response filter. The spatial convolution process moves through the input image, pixel by pixel, placing the resulting pixels in the output image.</p>
<p>The spatial convolution process uses a weighted average of the input pixel and its immediate neighbors to calculate the brightness value of the output pixel. The group of pixels used in the weighted average calculation is known as the kernel. The kernel is a mobile matrix, usually square, with an odd number of values in each dimension. If the kernel dimension is 1 x 1, it is point-by-point digital processing; the usual dimensions in group processing are 3 x 3 and 5 x 5. The larger the size of the pixel kernel used in the calculation, the more degrees of freedom the spatial filter has.</p>
<p>One way to perform this process is through masks. Basically, a mask is a small two-dimensional matrix (e.g., 3x3) whose element values are chosen to detect an image property.</p>
