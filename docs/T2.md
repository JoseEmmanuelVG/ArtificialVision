## **Linear Filter for Identification and Thresholding**

Filtering is a technique to modify or improve an image. Some of the image processing operations implemented with filters include smoothing, sharpness enhancement, and edge enhancement.

Image adjustment is the process of modifying images to make the results more suitable for visualization or further analysis.

### **Contrast Adjustment**
Reassigns intensity values to span the entire visualization range of the data type used. An image with good contrast has clear differences between black and white.

### **Object Analysis**
In an image, an edge is a curve that follows a path of rapid change in image intensity. Often, edges are associated with the boundaries of objects in a scene. Different algorithms are suitable for detecting edges of straight lines, round objects, or regions of arbitrary shapes. Conversely, homogeneous blocks lacking edges can also be detected.

**Edge Detection**
In an image, an edge is a curve that follows a path of rapid change in image intensity. Often, edges are associated with the boundaries of objects in a scene. Edge detection is used to identify the edges in an image.

To find edges, you can use the "edge" function. This function searches for places in the image where intensity changes rapidly using one of these two criteria:
- Places where the first derivative of intensity has a magnitude greater than the threshold.
- Places where the second derivative of intensity crosses zero.

The "edge" function provides various derivative estimators, each of which implements one of these definitions. In some of these estimators, you can specify whether the operation should detect horizontal, vertical, or both edges. The "edge" function returns a binary image with ones where there are edges and zeros elsewhere.

The best method for edge detection provided by the "edge" function is the Canny method. The Canny edge detection method differs from others in that it uses two different thresholds (to detect strong and weak edges) and includes weak edges in the result only if they are connected to strong edges. Therefore, this method is less likely to be affected by noise and more likely to detect weak real edges.
